Rough Draft, I have not put any of this to CSS to actually see if it will look good. I just wanted a baseline and threw in some colors, fonts, sizes etc based of vibes. 

1. Brand Personality & Tone
Modern & professional, emphasizing reliability.
Slightly playful undertone. Use humor to break monotony.

Overall vibe: polished, clean, tech-savvy with a hint of cosmic/arctic inspiration.

2. Typography
Element	Font | Family| 	Style/Weight	| Size (desktop)	| Notes
Headings (H1)	| 'Inter', sans-serif or 'Roboto', sans-serif | 	Bold (700)	2.5rem (~40px)	Clear, modern sans-serif, readable
Subheadings (H2, H3)	| Same as above |	Semi-bold (600)	| 1.75rem - 2rem	| Maintain hierarchy
Body Text |	'Open Sans', sans-serif or 'Lato', sans-serif	| Regular (400) |	1rem (~16px)	| Clean, easy on eyes
Code Font	| 'Fira Mono', monospace or 'Source Code Pro' |	Regular	0.9rem (~14px) | For inline code snippets or terminal style
Special UI | (blinking caret)	| Monospace or custom icon	|	Matches H1 line-height	| blinking > before name

Inter/Roboto/Open Sans justification: popular, very readable, and professional.


3. Color Palette
Purpose	Color Name	HEX	Notes
Background	White	#FFFFFF	Clean canvas
Text Primary	Almost Black	#121212	Softer than pure black (#000)
Accent 1	Deep Purple	#4B0082	Cosmic feel, rich & elegant
Accent 2	Ice Blue	#A7C7E7	Cool, calm, tech-inspired
Links & Buttons	Blue-ish Purple	#6A5ACD	Blend between purple & blue
Subtle Gray	Light Gray	#E0E0E0	For borders, subtle text

Food for thought: Use purple for headers, key highlights, and hover states.
Ice blue can highlight secondary buttons, backgrounds behind content cards, or subtle glows.

4. Layout & Spacing
Use a x-column grid system for structure (easy with CSS Grid or Flexbox).

Generous white space around sections for breathing room.

Consistent margins and padding, e.g., 24px–32px padding inside containers.

Content width maxed at ~960px or 1140px for readability.

5. Imagery & Icons
Use a circular crop for photo — clean and modern.
Secondary idea, PNG or SVG to make photo feel more borderless and integrated

Icons should be minimalistic

Keep icon strokes consistent (e.g., 2px).

Color icons in deep purple or ice blue for consistancy.

6. Visual Effects
Blinking caret (>) next to my name in the header with a subtle fade in/out — a nod to the terminal prompt, without being distracting.

Text fade-out effect on intro paragraphs or headers: use CSS gradients or opacity to gently fade edges.

Hover effects on buttons and links: color shifts from deep purple to ice blue or vice versa, smooth transition (~0.3s).

Keep animations subtle to maintain professionalism.

7. Accessibility (for future consideration)
Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background — deep purple and ice blue on white could meet contrast standards.

Use semantic HTML elements (<nav>, <section>, <main>, etc.)

Keyboard navigability on interactive elements.

Consider adding aria attributes if I decide to add more interactive components.
